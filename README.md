# Expense-Tracker-Webapp

As young adults living independently, we are in general expected to handle our finances. But as most of us live away from our parents' protective guidance for the very first time, it is easier said than done. 

For that purpose, we have decided to design and program an expense tracker that manages and logs both incoming and outgoing money. The application notes down the date and value of spending or gained money alongside maintaining a record of the type of expenditure or earring so that it ultimately becomes easier to track your finances and classify them so that further plans can be made accordingly. Furthermore, the app also takes inputs via voice commands, making it easier for the user to make quick entries to the database table. 
Additionally, both the spent money and income will be displayed on the app page so that the user can have an instant idea of their current financial standings.
