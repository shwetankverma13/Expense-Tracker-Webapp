# Expense-Tracker-Webapp

As young adults living independently, we are in general expected to handle our own finances. But as most of us are living away from the protective guidance of our parents for the very first time it is easier said than done.

For that purpose we have decided to design and program an expense tracker that manages both expenditure and income. The application logs the date and value of spending or gained money alongside maintaining a record of the type of expenditure or earring so that it ultimately becomes easier to not only track your finances but also classify them so that further plans can be made accordingly. Furthermore the app also takes inputs via voice commands making it yet again easier for the user to make quick entries to the database table. Additionally both the spent money and income will be displayed on the app page so that the user can have an instant idea of their current financial standings.
